Through the Ages is a digital version of the incredibly popular civilization board game of the same name (it was rated number 1 on BoardGameGeek for a long time, and as of 2018 the revised edition is currently number 3). It eschews normal civ-type 4x play for an engine-building card system that is satisfying to build and play with. It has two of the most important things any digital board game adaptation needs: a great tutorial, and an intuitive UI. I've played the physical version of TTA in the past, but it had been years since I played it last, so I needed to relearn it from scatch when I bought the digital edition. The tutorial does an excellent job of conveying the relatively complex rulset in an easily understandable manner. Aside from standard AI and multiplayer game modes, there are also a set of challenges to beat the game with slight rules tweaks, which helps to keep repeat sessions from becoming monotonous. Recommended for any fan of medium to heavy strategy games.
