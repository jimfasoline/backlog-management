"Walking Simulator" is a divisive genre of games that I've always enjoyed, both for their stories and for the fact that they typically have a much shorter playtime than a standard AAA game. The Magic Circle is a game that starts out feeling like a walking simulator, but soon gives the player the ability to manipulate the game to solve puzzles and fight enemies. I won't give away any more than that, because the process and feeling of discovery in this game is one of its strengths. 

The story is about your journey as a newly hired QA developer at a game studio trying to help get a game released that a perfectionist creator has been working on for decades. It's told mostly in voiceover, and the performances by James Urbaniak, Ashly Burch, Karen Dyer, and Stephen Russel are all well done. Recommended.
