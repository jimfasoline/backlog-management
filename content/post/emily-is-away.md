I figured I'd start out with an easy recommendation- Emily is Away is free, and it takes about a half hour to beat. The entire game is a series of conversations with a friend, Emily, using a messaging client that may look familiar to people of a certain age. This game struck a chord since I was right around the same age of the characters, but even if you didn't graduate high school in the early 2000s, there's a lot to relate to on all sides in this story.

Due to its short length and story-driven nature, I don't want to say much more for fear of giving anything away. Give it a shot.
