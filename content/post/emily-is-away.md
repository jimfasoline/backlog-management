I figured I'd start out with an easy recommendation- Emily is Away is free, and it takes about a half hour to beat. The entire game is a series of conversations with a friend, Emily, using a messaging client that may look very familiar to you. This game struck a chord since I was right around the same age of the characters, but even if you didn't graduate high school in the early 2000s, there's a lot to relate to on all sides in this story.
