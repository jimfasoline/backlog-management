![Rollers of the Realm](/images/rollersoftherealm.jpg)

Rollers of the Realm is an unusual mashup- it's a pinball game with the trappings of an RPG (or vice versa, maybe). The 'tables' aren't very complex, but the variety offered by the party system helps to break up any potential for monotony. Each memember of your party is represented by a different type of pinball, each with their own abilities, that change up how you can approach the areas. This game reminds me of what I fantasized NES Pinball could have been like when I was a kid, and it's an easy recommendation for me.
