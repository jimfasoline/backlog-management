I bought Minecraft back in 2011, but I didn't start playing it much until my friends I set up a server to play on together a few years after that. They already had experience with Minecraft, so they were able to help me navigate through some of the more confusing/arbitrary mechanics of the game. I really enjoyed the experience, and still do to this day (especially with friends), but I severly overstimated how many gamey mecahnics would be there involving the farming/mining/home building/etc.

Within an hour or two of starting the game, I realized that Stardew Valley was in many ways the game I hoped Minecraft would be. There are obvious differences- Stardew Valley is much more structured, until recently there was no multiplayer at all, and there's really no free-form building to speak of. What it does have, though, is more systems that reward your mining, farming, and combat efforts. There's a decent amount of flexibility, though, which allows you to ignore some parts of the game entirely and not be heavily punished. 

Definitely recommended if you are a Harvest Moon fan, or wish Minecraft did more with its mining and farming elements.
