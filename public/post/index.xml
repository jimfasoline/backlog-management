      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://backlog.management/images/emilyisaway.png&#34; alt=&#34;Emily is Away&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d start out with an easy recommendation- Emily is Away is free, and it takes about a half hour to beat. The entire game is a series of conversations with a friend, Emily, using a messaging client that may look very familiar to you. This game struck a chord since I was right around the same age of the characters, but even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t graduate high school in the early 2000s, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to relate to on all sides in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
